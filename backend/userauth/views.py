#No app level urls.py, it is in folder api in destiny's project

# Security

# Right now you’re exposing the raw user pk (uidb64 = user.pk). Normally, Django uses urlsafe_base64_encode to 
# encode it safely.

# from django.utils.http import urlsafe_base64_encode
# from django.utils.encoding import force_bytes
