from rest_framework import serializers
#The line from rest_framework import serializers imports Django REST Frameworkâ€™s powerful serializers module, 
# which is used to convert complex data types like Django models into native Python datatypes that can then be
# easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types â€” and vice versa. It enables developers to use tools
# like ModelSerializer, which automatically generates fields from a Django model, or Serializer, which allows
# manual definition of fields and validation logic. This module also supports custom validation through methods
# like validate_<fieldname> or by overriding validate() for more complex logic, and it facilitates nested 
# serialization to represent relationships between models such as ForeignKey or ManyToMany. For example, 
# a simple UserSerializer using ModelSerializer might look like this: class UserSerializer
# (serializers.ModelSerializer): class Meta: model = User; fields = ['id', 'username', 'email']. 
# This makes it easier to build APIs that are clean, efficient, and maintainable.
from rest_framework.validators import UniqueValidator 
#Ensures a field value is unique across the database â€” commonly used with email or username fields to 
# prevent duplicates during registration.
