def make_published(modeladmin, request, queryset):
#modeladmin is the instance of your custom ModelAdmin class ‚Äî passed automatically by Django when an admin 
# action is triggered. It gives access to: The model (modeladmin.model), admin methods and config, 
#Useful utilities like logging or saving changes.
#It comes from the Django admin system when you select rows and run an action ‚Äî Django calls your function like:
#make_published(self, request, queryset) Where self is your ModelAdmin instance ‚Äî passed as modeladmin.
    queryset.update(status="published")
#üöÄ Bulk-updates all selected rows in the queryset by setting their status field to "published" ‚Äî efficient 
# because it avoids looping and saves directly to the database in one query.
