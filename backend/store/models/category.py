#Category  causes circular import between product and category, review and product etc.


'''
Option 2: Use a Lazy Reference (String-based ForeignKey)
If Category does need a reference to Product (e.g., a ManyToManyField or ForeignKey), you can use a string-based 
reference instead of importing the Product class directly. Django allows you to specify the related model as a 
string in the format 'app_name.ModelName' or just 'ModelName' if the model is in the same app.
For example, in category.py:
pythonclass Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # Instead of ManyToManyField(Product, ...), use a string
    products = models.ManyToManyField('Product', related_name="categories",'''
# Or, if you need to specify the app name explicitly (e.g., store is your app):
# pythonproducts = models.ManyToManyField('store.Product', related_name="categorie

class Category(models.Model):
    # Category title
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # Image for the category
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to=user_directory_path, default='category.jpg', null =True, blank=True)
    # - Saves to path returned by user_directory_path
    # - Uses 'category.jpg' if no image is uploaded
    # Is the category active?
    active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    # Slug for SEO-friendly URLs
    slug = models.SlugField(null=True, blank=True)
    class Meta:
        verbose_name_plural = "Categories"
## Sets plural name for the model in Django admin as "Categories". This is purely for display‚Äîhelps Django
# admin show a human-friendly plural instead of auto-generating one like ‚ÄúCategorys‚Äù
    def thumbnail(self):
    # Returns a safe HTML <img> tag for displaying the image in Django admin:
    # - Uses image URL from mode,# - Sets fixed size (50x50), rounded corners, and cover fit
    # - mark_safe prevents Django from escaping the HTML
        return mark_safe('<img src="%s" width="50" height="50" style="object-fit:cover; border-radius: 6px;" />' % (self.image.url))
    # Typically used in ModelAdmin or model methods to preview images directly in the admin panel.
    '''In Django, when you return HTML content‚Äîlike an <img> tag‚Äîfrom a Python method, Django automatically escapes 
it to prevent security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS). That means it turns characters like < and > into
&lt; and &gt;, so the browser shows them as plain text instead of rendering them as HTML.

üîí Escaping protects users, but sometimes you want Django to treat your string as safe HTML‚Äîlike when you're
deliberately generating a trusted image tag for the admin panel.

That‚Äôs where mark_safe() comes in:

‚úÖ What mark_safe() does:
It tells Django: ‚ÄúThis HTML is safe, don‚Äôt escape it.‚Äù

So instead of showing &lt;img src="..."&gt;, it actually renders the image.

‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution:
Only use mark_safe() when you're 100% sure the content is safe and not coming from user input. Otherwise, 
you could open the door to malicious code injection.'''

#/*************************************************************************************************

# The issue in category.py is the circular import caused by the Product import in the product_count and cat_products methods, which reference Product.objects directly. This creates a circular dependency because product.py imports Category, and category.py references Product. To resolve this, I'll move the Product import inside the product_count and cat_products methods to delay the import until the methods are called, thus avoiding circular imports. I'll also use a string-based reference ('store.Category') for the ForeignKey in the Tag model, as you already have it correctly set up. All comments will be preserved, and no ForeignKey relationships will be changed.
# Changes Made to category.py

# Removed Product References at Module Level:

# The product_count and cat_products methods directly used Product.objects, which requires importing Product at the module level and causes a circular import with product.py.
# Moved the Product import inside the product_count and cat_products methods to delay the import until the methods are executed.


# Preserved String-based ForeignKey:

# The ForeignKey in the Tag model already uses 'store.Category', which is correct and avoids importing Category directly. No changes were needed here.


# Preserved All Comments: All comments, including explanations about mark_safe, on_delete=models.PROTECT, verbose_name, ordering, and other Django concepts, are kept verbatim.
# Fixed Minor Typos:

# Corrected save method's *arg to *args for proper Python syntax.
# Ensured consistent spacing and formatting for readability, while keeping all comments intact.
