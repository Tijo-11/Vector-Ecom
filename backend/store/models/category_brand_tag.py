from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
from shortuuid.django_fields import ShortUUIDField
#Imports a Django model field that generates short, unique IDs using the shortuuid library.
#Useful for replacing default UUIDs with shorter, URL-friendly identifiers in Django models.
from django.utils.html import mark_safe #Marks a string as safe for HTML rendering in templates.
#Prevents Django from auto-escaping HTML tags, allowing raw HTML to be rendered. Use cautiously to avoid XSS risks.
from django.utils import timezone#Provides timezone-aware date and time utilities.
#Used to get the current time (timezone.now()) that respects Django‚Äôs configured timezone settings.
from django.template.defaultfilters import escape#Escapes HTML special characters in a string
#Converts <, >, &, etc. into safe entities (&lt;, &gt;, &amp;) to prevent HTML injection in templates.
from django.urls import reverse #Generates the URL path for a given view name.
#Used to dynamically build URLs in views or templates, avoiding hardcoding and ensuring maintainability.
#Instead of hardcoding a URL like "/products/42/", you can do:reverse("product-detail", args=[42])
#This will return the correct URL for the view named "product-detail" with ID 42, based on your urls.py setup.
#Why it's useful: If you ever change your URL patterns, reverse() keeps your code working without manual updates.
from django.shortcuts import redirect #Redirects the user to a different URL or view.
#Commonly used in views after form submission or login to send users to another page(e.g., redirect('home')).
from django.dispatch import receiver #Decorator that connects a function to a Django signal.
#Used to trigger custom logic when specific events occur (e.g., model save/delete), like:
#@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
# def do_something(sender, instance, **kwargs): This runs do_something after MyModel is saved.
from django.utils.text import slugify#Converts a string into a URL-friendly ‚Äúslug‚Äù.
#Replaces spaces and special characters with hyphens, and lowercases the text 
# ‚Äî useful for clean URLs like "My Blog Post" ‚Üí "my-blog-post".
from django.core.validators import MinValueValidator, MaxValueValidator
#Adds validation constraints to numeric fields in Django models.
#Ensures values stay within a defined range ‚Äî e.g., MinValueValidator(1) prevents values below 1, and 
# MaxValueValidator(100) blocks values above 100.
from django.db.models.signals import post_save#Signal triggered after a model instance is saved.
#Used to run custom logic (e.g., sending emails, updating related models) right after save() is called on a 
# model. Commonly paired with @receiver.

import shortuuid#Imports the shortuuid library to generate short, unique, URL-safe IDs.
#It's a compact alternative to Python‚Äôs built-in uuid, often used for cleaner database keys or public-facing identifiers.
import datetime
#Imports Python‚Äôs built-in datetime module for working with dates and times.
#Used to create, manipulate, and format date/time objects ‚Äî e.g., datetime.datetime.now() gives the current timestamp.
import os
#Imports Python‚Äôs os module for interacting with the operating system.
#Used for tasks like reading environment variables, handling file paths, or accessing the file system ‚Äî e.g., 
# os.path.join() or os.getenv().

    '''In Django, when you return HTML content‚Äîlike an <img> tag‚Äîfrom a Python method, Django automatically escapes 
it to prevent security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS). That means it turns characters like < and > into
&lt; and &gt;, so the browser shows them as plain text instead of rendering them as HTML.

üîí Escaping protects users, but sometimes you want Django to treat your string as safe HTML‚Äîlike when you're
deliberately generating a trusted image tag for the admin panel.

That‚Äôs where mark_safe() comes in:

‚úÖ What mark_safe() does:
It tells Django: ‚ÄúThis HTML is safe, don‚Äôt escape it.‚Äù

So instead of showing &lt;img src="..."&gt;, it actually renders the image.

‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution:
Only use mark_safe() when you're 100% sure the content is safe and not coming from user input. Otherwise, 
you could open the door to malicious code injection.'''
