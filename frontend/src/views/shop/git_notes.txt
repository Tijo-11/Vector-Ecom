Git Note: Inspecting a Previous Commit in Detached HEAD State

To temporarily inspect a previous commit without affecting your current branch:

Checkout the commit (detached HEAD):

bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
This puts you in a detached HEAD state, allowing you to explore or test without modifying any branches.

Inspect or experiment freely: You can view files, run tests, or even make temporary commits. These won't affect your branches unless you explicitly save them.

Return to the tip of your branch:

bash
git switch <branch-name>
This brings you back to the latest commit on your branch, exiting the detached state.

Example:

bash
git checkout 9d74a4a8   # Go to older commit
# ...inspect or test...
git switch main         # Return to latest commit on 'main'
This is a safe way to explore history without disrupting your current work.

Confirm you're at the tip:

bash
git log --oneline -1
This shows the most recent commit on your current branch. If it matches the commit you expect, you're at the tip.
